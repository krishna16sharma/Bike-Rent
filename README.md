# Bike-Rent
A simple Web application to predict the number of bikes rented based on temperature, humidity and wind speed

## About the Project
This is a good project to get familiar with flask and learn to deploy a web application using Heroku.

The dataset has 5 columns - date, temperature, humidity, count.
The variable which we need to predict is count. This is the count of bikes rented out (in use) given the weather conditions.
The dataset can be found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cambridgecoding/machinelearningregression/master/data/bikes.csv).

The data was first visualized and then the model was trained.<br>
A simple UI was built using HTML and CSS.<br>
Flask was used to integrate the model with the UI.<br>
Finally, the application was deployed using heroku.<br>
